                        No, woman, no cry<br>
                        No, woman, no cry<br>

                        <br>
                        I remember when we used to sit<br>
                        In the government yard in trenchtown<br>
                        Ob-observing the hypocrites<br>
                        As they would mingle with the good people we meet<br>
                        Good friends we have, oh, good friends we have lost<br>
                        Along the way<br>
                        In this great future, you can't forget your past<br>
                        So dry your tears, I said<br>
                        <br>
                        No, woman, no cry<br>
                        No, woman, no cry<br>
                        Oh, little darling, don't shed no tears<br>
                        No, woman, no cry<br>
                        <br>
                        Said I remember when we used to sit<br>
                        In the government yard in trenchtown<br>
                        And then georgie would make the fire lights<br>
                        As it was logwood burning through the nights<br>
                        Then we would cook cornmeal porridge<br>
                        Of which I'll share with you<br>
                        My feet is my only carriage<br>
                        So I've got to push on through<br>
                        <br>
                        But while I'm gone, I mean<br>

                        Everything gonna be alright!<br>
                        Everything gonna be alright!<br>
                        I said, everything gonna be alright!<br>
                        Everything gonna be alright!<br>
                        Everything gonna be alright, now!<br>
